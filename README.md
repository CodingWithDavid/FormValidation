# Blazor Form Validation

This project was created to help me learn about form validation in a Blazor Application.  I also added in navigating to other pages from C# code.

## Why

We will be modifying the standard Weather forecast sample that ships as one of the pages in the project templates.  We will be changing it cities displaying their temperatures.  

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/FormValidation
   cd BlazorDisplayImages
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio or Visual Code
a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

The application is straight forward. User clicks an "Add" button, is taken to a new page where they can add new city's weather.  We are not persisting the data so any additions that are made are discarded with the application closes
